# odin-recipes
A basic html website that is a cookbook.
It shows a single recipe, fried chicken, and details how to make it.
The home page is a bit basic, but since this is my first github project I will leave it more basic
until I learn how to style it.
Feel free to email me (see my profile) with any advice,tips etc.
Thanks again for taking the time to look at my work
